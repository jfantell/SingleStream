# SingleStream: All-In-One Music Player and Social Network

Developers: Roshni Vachhani, Ryan Flynn, John Fantell, Will Stone, Robert Rotering

Project Description: Music Is Everywhere but now you will not have to be. Music lovers should not have to decide what media platform they would like to use when their favorite songs are scattered across them. SingleStream puts your favorite songs from various media platforms in one place -- a combination of your favorite tracks from Spotify, freestyles from SoundCloud, and remixes from YouTube together like they should be. But SingleStream is not only a music hub -- it is a social network made of and for music enthusiasts. Share your favorite songs, explore new artists, challenge your friends in music trivia and more.
