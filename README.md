# SingleStream: All-In-One Music Player and Social Network

Developers: Roshni Vachhani, Ryan Flynn, John Fantell, Will Stone, Robert Rotering

Project Description: Music Is Everywhere but now you will not have to be. Music lovers should not have to decide what media platform they would like to use when their favorite songs are scattered across them. SingleStream puts your favorite songs from various media platforms in one place -- a combination of your favorite tracks from Spotify, freestyles from SoundCloud, and remixes from YouTube together like they should be. But SingleStream is not only a music hub -- it is a social network made of and for music enthusiasts. Share your favorite songs, explore new artists, challenge your friends in music trivia and more.


CHANGES:

3/22/17: Added two folders: Settings and npm_test_packages. The latter folder will be used for simply tinkering with npm packages/apis. The former folder contains a folder called "working_example". Here you will find a node server file (server.js) and public directory containing an index.html file. To run the server, you must enter "node server.js." Then you can go to localhost:3000. There are three buttons on the index page. The first will allow you to sync your YouTube data with the SingleStream app. The second and third buttons will allow you to sync SoundCloud and Spotify data, respectively, with the SingleStream app. Right now only the YouTube button is semi-functional. It does not store any data but it logs it in the console. Data (specifically media uris, and song/video metadata will be stored in a mongo database).


4/12/17:

Added back end interface. Combined front-end prototypes with it.
